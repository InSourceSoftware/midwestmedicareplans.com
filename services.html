description: As an independent, licensed, Medicare insurance plan agent/broker, my
  business assists clients with knowledge and understanding of all insurance plan
  options. This includes Medicare Supplement policies, Medicare Advantage Prescription
  Drug plans, and Part D Prescription Drug Plans for your out of pocket health-care
  and prescription costs. In addition for you I give advice on Dental, Vision, and
  Hearing insurance plans, as well as enrolling you if requested. I offer to review
  all your insurance needs. This would include considering your age, health status,
  and retirement income available to use. Then I recommend the best value plan with
  the most benefit for the cost of premiums spent. In the future I will continue watching
  out for insurance changes which would affect you. In addition you will be comfortable
  you have checked another box toward gathering peace of mind in retirement.
