When you turn age 65 you could begin your 6 month Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period (OEP). Starting Medicare Part B begins your OEP. 
  
If you choose not to start your Medicare Part B and stay in a group health plan of creditable coverage, 
you can use the open enrollment period later.  

Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD)Plans have an Initial Coverage Election Period (ICEP), which begins three months immediately before the person's first enrollment eligibility to both Medicare Part A and Part B. 
The ICEP ends on the later date of: The final day of the month before eligibility to both Part A and Part B or; 
The last day of the person's Part B initial enrollment period.

The October 15-December 7 Annual Election Period (AEP)allows you to change a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan effective for the new calendar year.

The AEP does not affect Medicare Supplement Insurance.   

Let's talk through your options.
