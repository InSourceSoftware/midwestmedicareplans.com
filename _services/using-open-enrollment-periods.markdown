When you turn age 65 you could begin your 6 month Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period. 
If you choose not to start your Medicare Part B and stay in a group health plan of creditable coverage, 
you can use the open enrollment period later.  

Medicare Advantage Plans have an Initial Coverage Election Period (ICEP), which begins three months
immediately before the person's first entitlement to both Medicare Part A Part B. 
The ICEP ends on the later of: The last day of the month preceding entitlement to both Part A and Part B or; 
The last day of the person's Part B initial enrollment period.
