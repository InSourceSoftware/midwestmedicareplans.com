If you are enrolled in, or are considering enrolling in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may be asking  some of the following questions. 

What is this ANOC (Annual Notice Of Change) I received in the mail? What is an HMO or a PPO network? May I choose for my health care any Medical Center in the U.S.? Is my regular doctor able to refer me to any specialist? Are there penalties for choosing providers outside of the HMO or PPO network?

If you contact me for a Free-No Charge Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan annual review, we will cover every question you have on these and other related topics. Annually we will review the trends in Medicare Advantage plans. Trends are the increase in dollars and percentage in your Maximum Out of Pocket costs (MOOP) responsibility for the next calendar year. This would include reviewing published increases in the plan's deductible (if any)in dollars, copay dollar amounts, coinsurance dollar amounts, for medical services for the next year. I represent the best Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans. I will know these amounts shortly before or immediately as you are notified.These will take effect each January 1.
