As you approach age 65 what is the month you plan on starting Medicare Part B?

Even if you do not yet know, you will want to contact me for a health eligibility review of your Medicare Supplement Plan options. You have only a six month Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period to buy a plan without health and medication questions. The six month period begins in the month you are age 65 or older and have enrolled in Medicare Part B. After this period, you may still qualify for a plan. You must be approved through medical underwriting based on your answers to health and prescription medication useage questions. I am able to provide you a free eligibility review of the questions without submitting an application. Approval is dependent on the carrier's process of underwriting. 

Why should you ask me for a Medicare Supplement affordability review?

It's free and when we determine the answer you will know what plan you may be comfortable with. The review consists of helping you know your options for maximizing the value of dollars spent on health-care premiums. Premium comparison of 3 carrier plans is done based on your zip code.
