A Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) Medicare Part D insurance plan manages annual medication costs in exchange for a level monthly premium. 

If you have insurance coverage for medications, do you know exactly how you are receiving that coverage? I want to be the professional you trust for service and recommendations, if needed, for this very important insurance coverage. You may receive an annual prescription drug plan review at no cost at all to you. A PDP’s premium and benefits, including drug tiers, co-pays, and coinsurance are compared to other plans available to you.
Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) is an optional benefit. To get Medicare prescription drug coverage, you must just join a plan approved by Medicare that offers Medicare drug coverage. Each plan can vary in cost and specific drugs covered. You must have Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B to join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Medicare Prescription Drug Plans are also called Stand Alone Part D plans. you may enroll in this type of plan with original Medicare. You are not required to have a Medicare Supplement Plan (Medigap) to enroll in a Stand Alone PDP. Medicare Advantage Plans or other Medicare health plans may offer Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D). You get all of your Part A, Part B, and prescription drug coverage (Part D) through these plans. Medicare Advantage Plans with prescription drug coverage are sometimes called “MA-PD plans” Remember, you must have Part A and Part B to join a Medicare Advantage Plan, and not all of these plans offer drug coverage. A different MA-PD, or a PDP may be chosen, and enrolled into from October 15-December 7, called the Annual Election Period (AEP).
