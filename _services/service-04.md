Budgeting and Income coaching for 2 hours at no cost. 

Have you experienced too much month at the end of your money? Together, at no charge, we will look at where your money is being spent. If you want a Medicare Supplement insurance policy which is a level monthly premium, your monthly budget must have money for it. We know the premium will increase each year. Together we will determine a plan to afford the cost of a Medicare Supplement Insurance policy. You could review if you should apply for Medicaid which may reduce your premium costs in “Original Medicare?” Let's talk soon. Annual budget consultations are free when you become my client. Consultations are by e-mail and phone.
