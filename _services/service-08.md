Have you heard a sales pitch for extra Medicare benefits you deserve, such as dental coverage? Is a celebrity telling you to call an 800 phone number for free information on zero dollars monthly premium Medicare plans? did you hear the ad say vision and hearing services are covered? Should you agree to have a licensed agent call to explain it to you? Yes, you should call me because I represent the best Medicare plans. No need to make an appointment with 2 or 3 agents. While meeting with me you will have the information on dental, vision, and hearing benefits. Then you may confidently take action, make important changes, or continue with your current carrier's Medicare plan.
