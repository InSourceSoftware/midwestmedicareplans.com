## Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan (MA-PD)

Pays healthcare and prescription costs in one private insurance company plan.  

A Medicare Advantage Plan is another way to get your health-care coverage. Medicare Advantage is an “all in one” alternative to Original Medicare. You must continue paying Part A premiums if applicable, and Part B premiums. Sometimes called “Part C” or ‘MA plans”, Medicare-approved private insurance companies must follow rules set by Medicare. If you enroll, you are leaving original Medicare. In some plans for instance an HMO MA-PD plan, you must use network providers. There may be some exceptions such as emergencies. You will receive your coverage from the private company you enrolled with. 

Your coverage may change each year. For example your Maximum Out of Pocket cost may increase each year. Or an annual plan deductible such as $1,000 may be applied. Claims questions, appeals, grievances, and complaints must be filed with the private insurance company you enrolled with. During the Annual Election Period (AEP) October 15-December 7, you may return to original Medicare, or choose another MA-PD plan to enroll with which would become effective the following January 1. 

The options you have in MA-PD plans are determined by your eligibility for Medicare Part A and Part B. Additionally by the state and county you live in. These options are explained in a paper enrollment booklet, or online, by the private company which has a contract with Medicare. Not all plans are offered in all counties. Some counties may not have any plan options. 

Some plans offer extra benefits that original Medicare doesn’t cover-like dental, vision, hearing,  and wellness .
