## Medicare Supplement Insurance Policy (Medigap policies)

Pays healthcare costs that Medicare does not.
Adapted from “Medicare and You” (page 69-72), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Original Medicare pays for much,but not all, of the cost for covered health care services and supplies. Medicare Supplement Insurance policies,sold by private companies, can help pay some of the remaining health care costs for covered services and supplies, like copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.Medicare Supplement Insurance policies are also called Medigap policies. 

Some Medigap policies also offer coverage for services that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, like medical care when you travel outside the U.S. Generally, Medigap policies don’t cover long-term care (like care in a nursing home), vision or dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, or private-duty nursing.

This 6 month period begins on the first day of the month in which you’re 65 or older and                         enrolled in Part B. After this enrollment period, you may not be able to buy a Medigap 
 policy. If you’re able to buy one, it may cost more. Medicare Supplement Health Plans may require answering medical questions.
