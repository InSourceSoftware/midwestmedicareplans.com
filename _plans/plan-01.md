## Medicare Supplement Insurance Policy (Medigap policies)

Original Medicare leaves deductibles and coinsurance amounts the beneficiary is responsible to pay the provider. Medicare Supplement (Medigap) Insurance policies pay some remaining healthcare costs that Medicare approved.  

Some Medigap policies also offer coverage for services that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, like medical care when you travel outside the U.S. Generally, Medigap policies don’t cover long-term care (like care in a nursing home), vision or dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, or private-duty nursing.
