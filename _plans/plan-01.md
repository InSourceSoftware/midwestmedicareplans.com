## Medicare Supplement Insurance Policy (Medigap policies)

Original Medicare leaves deductibles and coinsurance amounts the beneficiary is responsible to pay the provider. Medicare Supplement insurance policies pay some of the remaining healthcare costs that Medicare approved.  

You may count on my experience to guide you in this very complex area of Medicare. 

You must have original Medicare Part A and Part B.

You must apply for a Medicare Supplement policy. 

If issued a policy, you pay the private insurance company a monthly premium for your Medicare Supplement policy in addition to your monthly Part B premium that you pay to Medicare. 

A Medicare Supplement policy covers one person not a spouse though a separate application can be made for the spouse.

It’s important to compare prices and have an independent agent assist you to shop for the best values. Monthly premiums increase as you age.  

When should you buy a Medicare Supplement policy?
Immediately when you are eligible is the safest guideline. 

Everyone newly eligible for Medicare will have a 6 month open Enrollment Period for a Medicare Supplement application to be issued. This 6 month period begins on the first day of the month in which you’re 65 or older and enrolled in Part B. 

After this enrollment period, medical underwriting may apply. Find an independent agent such as myself to help you since I understand medical questions in the underwriting process. 

Guaranteed Issue (No health questions) may be an option for certain circumstances. Ask me for help. It's something I do for my clients to help them get the right coverage and most value for the dollars they spend.

You may save thousands of dollars over your lifetime by a well informed decision now.
