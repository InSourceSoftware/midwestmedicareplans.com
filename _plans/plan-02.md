A Prescription Drug Plan(PDP)is a Medicare Part D optional benefit. You should consider enrolling in a plan even if you use few or no prescription drugs at this time. The cost of a plan may be within your budget if you shop carefully. We can find potentially one,two,or more plans which would help you. There are several reliable well known companies which I carefully selected to represent. 

Some Medicare Advantage (MA) plans have built in prescription drug coverage (MA-PD). Your county and state of residence may determine which plans are offered in your location. It is convenient and easy to enroll over the phone and internet with me. 

At the time you first join Medicare Part A or Part B you may select a PDP. Be aware of penalties Medicare may impose later if you chose not to have any creditable coverage but need it later. 

The Annual Election Period (AEP) open enrollment is from October 15-December 7 for the following January 1 effective date.

A (PDP)is complex so count on me to work with you in choosing your best option.
  
Before you leave an employer or union group plan be aware you may not be able to get it back.
