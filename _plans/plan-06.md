## Long Term Care Insurance policy needs, features, and benefits.

For level premiums you pay, a Long Term Care policy pays benefits when a doctor certifies a need for custodial care. As you age, you may need help with things you’ve always been able to do yourself – shopping for groceries, fixing meals, cleaning the house. You may also need help with personal services, like bathing, dressing or taking medications. A long-term care insurance policy is designed to help you pay for some of these types of services.

Waiting for Benefits to Begin. When you purchase a long-term care insurance policy, you will select a waiting period, called an elimination period during which time any costs for long-term care services are your responsibility. You have the option to choose how to receive payment of policy benefits. A traditional reimbursement benefit is payable after satisfying your policy’s elimination period. Or you can elect to receive a cash benefit with no elimination period to satisfy.
